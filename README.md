# zkldi's Playground

This is a monorepo for all my experiments and small projects.

They're all hosted on `https://zkldi.xyz/playground`.

## [Distro Picker](https://github.com/zkldi/playground/tree/master/distro-picker)

This is a simple Linux distro picker aimed at beginners. An issue I had with a lot of existing pickers was that they seemed to be really excited to show off as many distros as possible.

This is great for experienced Linux users looking for something new to tinker with, but for beginners? Don't recommend them Arch, come on!

The tool was built in a day, and was done as an exercise to learn [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). The conclusion? Svelte is great.
